# Hello-World

My name is Edward (legal name Jianlin) Guo and I am a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering Co-op graduate from the University of Alberta. I have been coding since first year universtiy (Jan 2018) in MATLAB and have since learned Python (2019), \LaTeX (2019), Bash (2019)  VBA for Excel Macros (2019), C/C++ (2021), HTML/CSS (2023) and starting to apply to JavaScript. 

My motivation for creating this is to document my journey with HTML/CSS/JavaScript starting with some web development topics. I then plan to create some mobile apps targeted for guitar (tuner, chord sheets, progressions, etc.).
